title: Classification and gene selection of microarray data using Neural Networks and AdaBoost
authors: Anna Lu, Yang Wan
abstract: Gene classification is a common task in expression studies. However, univariate gene selection  
by ranking is inaccurate, insufficient for multiclass microarray data. AdaBoost and Neural Networks are  
proposed as more robust methods for microarray data classification appropriate for multi-class problems.  
MATLAB’s built-in neural network library and AdaBoost in MATLAB’s Classification Learning App are used to  
assess the error rate in classification of three microarray datasets: leukaemia, brain, and NCI 60 human  
tumor cell lines. These three microarray data sets are selected for their variable number of classes.  
Findings show that AdaBoost provides greater accuracy than neural network for the three selected microarray  
datasets. Both AdaBoost and neural network are robust to variable number of classes: two, five, and eight  
for leukemia, brain, and NCI 60 respectively.
